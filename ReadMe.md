<h2> What is Advent Of Code?</h2>
<p></p>Advent of code is a series of coding problems, based on Christmas. These problems are created by Eric Wastl, you can find the website <a href= "https://adventofcode.com/">here</a>. <br>
I will not be sharing my puzzle inputs or text, if you would like to find the puzzle text please go <a href= "https://adventofcode.com/2019">here</a> for the 2019 version, which is the one I am doing. <br>
</p>

<h2> Why am I doing this?</h2>
<p> During this I will be documenting my trial on the 2019 challenges. I am going to do these challenges in python, to help improve my problem solving, logical thinking and coding skills. <br>
I am going to try these challenges by my self, without any external help, however if you find a more effective solution I urge you to create a pull request, with detail to help me improve! <br>
During this I won't be commenting any of my code, as frankly I am lazy.
